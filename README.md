## setup termux for pubkey auth

Looking for debian setup instead? [click here](#for-debian-setup-assuming-you-have-clean-slate)

Here’s a straightforward way to set up **passwordless SSH login from Windows → Termux** so you won’t need to enter your password each time. I’ll summarize the process using the [Termux Wiki](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Remote_Access) and a practical [GitHub guide](https://gist.github.com/evandrocoan/f503188587587d7b1d1ba8746c9c6107):

### Steps

1. **Install SSH support in Termux (Android side)**  
   Open Termux and install OpenSSH:  
   ```bash
   pkg upgrade
   pkg install openssh
   ```
   Start the SSH server (listens on port `8022` by default):  
   ```bash
   sshd
   ```

2. **Generate an SSH key on your Windows machine**  
   On Windows 10/11 you can use PowerShell:  
   ```powershell
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
   ```
   Press enter to save it as the default (`C:\Users\YourName\.ssh\id_rsa`). Leave passphrase empty if you truly want no prompts.

3. **Copy your public key to Termux**  
   From Windows, run (replace `PHONE_IP` with the LAN IP of your Android):  
   ```powershell
   scp -P 8022 C:\Users\YourName\.ssh\id_rsa.pub u0_aXXX@PHONE_IP:~/.ssh/authorized_keys
   ```
   Notes:  
   - Create the `.ssh` folder in Termux first if needed: `mkdir -p ~/.ssh`  
   - Replace `u0_aXXX` with the actual Termux user (Termux internally uses these, but usually you can just put any user and it will default to Termux’s one).  

   Alternatively, you can copy-paste the contents of `id_rsa.pub` into `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` inside Termux.

4. **Fix permissions in Termux**  
   In Termux, run:  
   ```bash
   chmod 700 ~/.ssh && \
   chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
   ```

5. **(Optional but recommended) Disable password authentication**  
   Edit Termux’s sshd config:  
   ```bash
   nano $PREFIX/etc/ssh/sshd_config
   ```
   Set:
   ```
   PasswordAuthentication no
   PubkeyAuthentication yes
   ```
   Restart the ssh server:  
   ```bash
   pkill sshd && sshd
   ```

6. **Connect without password from Windows**  
   Now you should be able to connect directly:  
   ```powershell
   ssh -p 8022 PHONE_IP
   ```

   It will log in using the private key (`id_rsa`) and won’t prompt for a password anymore.

### When you try to login, it will error for a bit, something like: `Permission denied`. Fix:

### 1. Use your **`~/.ssh/config`** file
Create or edit the config file at:

```
C:\Users\<YourName>\.ssh\config
```

Add an entry like this ([Stack Overflow suggestion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/84096/setting-the-default-ssh-key-location)):

```
Host phone
    HostName 192.168.0.50
    Port 8022
    User u0_aXXX
    IdentityFile C:/Users/<YourName>/.ssh/id_rsa (pls locate the right id_rsa file)
```

Now you can just run:
```powershell
ssh phone
```
It’ll automatically pick the right port, user, and key.


## transfer/ copy file to the remote machine

```
scp -P 8022 "file.txt" phone:~
```




## for debian setup (assuming you have clean slate)

follow generate key on windows host like above, but don't transfer yet. Your remote debian most likely don't have .ssh folder. Create first

```bash
ssh user@10.147.XX.XXX -p 8022
```

then

```bash
mkdir ~/.ssh && \
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
```

then

```bash
exit
```

then, use command below to transfer pubkey to your remote debian system

```
scp -P 8022 C:\Users\<user>\.ssh\id_rsa.pub user@10.147.XX.XXX:~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Try login. Should be there is no prompt for password anymore and you will log in.
